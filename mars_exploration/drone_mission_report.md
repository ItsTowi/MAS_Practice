# Drone Crew Mission Plan

## Drone Specific Objectives

1. **Drone ID: drone_0**
   - Objective: Capture high-resolution images of the rock formation at N52.
   - Route: ['N8', 'N64', 'N16', 'N98', 'N80', 'N32', 'N96', 'N52']
   - Distance: Approximately 34.13 units
   - Safe to operate within range limits.

2. **Drone ID: drone_1**
   - Objective: Perform an aerial survey of the crater edge at N3.
   - Route: ['N3', 'N74', 'N60', 'N12', 'N8']
   - Distance: Approximately 34.96 units
   - Safe to operate within range limits.

## Hazardous Zones/sectors

- **Dust Storms**: Avoid sector N10.
- **Radiation Spikes**: Avoid node N99 and areas near it, particularly the path from N3 to N52 via Node N96.
