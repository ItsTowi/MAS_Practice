# Drone Crew Mission Plan

## Mission Overview
This report details the finalized flight plan for the drone crew execution of scientific objectives. All drones have been validated with no hazardous zones encountered during planning. The mission operates within safe parameters with no deviations required.

## Drone Assignments
| Drone ID | Target Node | Distance (m) | Camera Resolution |
|----------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| drone_0  | N1           | 25            | 20MP                |
| drone_1  | N2           | 10            | 12MP                |
| drone_2  | N25          | 5             | 15MP                |
| drone_3  | N75          | 3             | 15MP                |
| drone_4  | N53          | 2             | 12MP                |

## Route Specifications
Each drone executes a direct flight path to its assigned target node with no intermediate waypoints. The route is optimized for minimal energy expenditure while maintaining scientific observation requirements.

## Energy Consumption Analysis
*Note: Energy consumption calculations require drone-specific power models not provided in this dataset. Distance flown serves as the primary metric for operational planning.*

| Drone ID | Distance Flown (m) | Energy Proxy (m) |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| drone_0  | 25                  | 25                |
| drone_1  | 10                  | 10                |
| drone_2  | 5                   | 5                 |
| drone_3  | 3                   | 3                 |
| drone_4  | 2                   | 2                 |
