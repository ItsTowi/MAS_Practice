# MasterMissionPlan: Sector B Rock Composition Analysis & Sector C Mapping  

## 1. **Header**  
**Mission ID**: MISP-2023-10-05-001  
**Global Status**: Active | Dust Storm Alert (Sector C) | Rover_0 Battery Critical  

---

## 2. **Executive Summary**  
This mission prioritizes **Sector B rock composition analysis** using drone and rover assets while **contingently addressing Sector C mapping** post-dust storm mitigation. Key strategies include:  
- **Drone DRN-01** conducts immediate aerial surveys of Sector B (Nodes 5–7) to identify sampling sites.  
- **Rover 1** (N12, 0.8 battery) deploys to Sector B for in-situ analysis, while **Rover 2** (en route to N12) prepares for potential Sector C operations.  
- **Rover 0** (N90, 0.5 battery) is rescheduled for charging to avoid operational failure during transit.  
- **Satellite monitoring** tracks the dust storm in Sector C, ensuring real-time weather updates for contingency planning.

|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|  
| **00:00 UTC**  | **Satellite** | Initiates continuous weather monitoring of Sector C (dust storm tracking) | Pre-mission setup                      |  
| **00:15 UTC**  | **Drone DRN-01** | Completes high-resolution topographic/spectral analysis of Sector B (Nodes 5–7) | Satellite weather data validation      |  
| **00:30 UTC**  | **Rover 1**   | Departs N12 for Sector B (estimated travel time: 45 mins)                  | Drone survey results available         |  
| **01:15 UTC**  | **Rover 2**   | Arrives at N12; begins transit to Sector B (if needed)                     | Rover 1’s sampling progress monitored  |  
| **02:00 UTC**  | **Satellite** | Updates storm severity in Sector C (High → Medium)                         | Weather data from global sensors      |  
| **02:30 UTC**  | **Rover 1**   | Completes surface sampling and spectroscopy in Sector B                    | Drone data alignment confirmed         |  
| **03:00 UTC**  | **Rover 2**   | Deploys to Sector C for topographic mapping (if storm mitigated)          | Satellite weather confirmation         |

## 4. **Detailed Orders**  

### **Rover Crew**  
- **Rover 1 (N12, 0.8 battery)**:  
  - Traverse to Sector B (Nodes 5–7) to collect surface samples and perform in-situ spectroscopy.  
  - Sync with Drone DRN-01’s survey data to target high-priority sampling sites.  
- **Rover 2 (N16, en route to N12)**:  
  - Continue transit to N12; upon arrival, assist Rover 1 in sampling or prepare for Sector C mapping if storm conditions improve.  
- **Rover 0 (N90, 0.5 battery)**:  
  - **Rescheduled for charging** at base station to avoid critical battery failure during transit.  

### **Drone Crew**  
- **Drone DRN-01**:  
  - Conduct aerial topographic and spectral analysis of Sector B (Nodes 5–7) to identify sampling sites.  
  - Transmit real-time data to Satellite for storm impact assessment.  

### **Satellite Crew**  
- **Satellite Network**:  
  - Monitor dust storm progression in Sector C, updating weather forecasts hourly.  
  - Validate Rover 2’s deployment to Sector C only after confirming storm severity is reduced.

## 5. **Risk & Resource Report**  

### **Battery Usage Estimates**  
- **Rover 1**: 0.8 battery (sufficient for Sector B operations).  
- **Rover 2**: 0.9 battery (adequate for transit and potential Sector C mapping).  
- **Rover 0**: 0.5 battery (critical; rescheduled for charging).  

### **Hazards Avoided**  
- **Dust Storm Mitigation**: Satellite monitoring prevents Rover 2 from deploying to Sector C during high-severity conditions.  
- **Resource Conflict**: Rover 0’s critical battery level is resolved via rescheduling, avoiding mission-critical failures.  

---

## 6. **Resolved Conflicts**  
**Issue**: Resource conflict with Rover_0 (0.5 battery level).  
**Resolution**:  
- **Action Taken**: Rover_0 is rescheduled for charging at the base station.  
- **Impact**: Ensures operational readiness for future missions; prevents potential transit failure.
