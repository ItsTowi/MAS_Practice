# MISSION PLAN: MarsHazardAssessment

## Strategic Overview
**Approved Targets:** N12, N45, N78
**Restricted Zones:** N5, N90

## 🛠️ Tactical Action Sequence

* **Rover in Node N12**: Subsurface sampling. Rationale: Rocky terrain with stable geological structure for safe subsurface operations
* **Rover in Node N45**: Subsurface sampling. Rationale: Rocky terrain with stable geological structure for safe subsurface operations
* **Rover in Node N78**: Subsurface sampling. Rationale: Rocky terrain with stable geological structure for safe subsurface operations

## Safety & Emergency Protocols
- If rover detects radiation spikes in sandy terrain (N90), immediately retreat to nearest rocky zone (N12/N45/N78)
- If crater instability is detected (N5), activate emergency stabilization protocol and abort all operations

## Detailed Expert Analysis
## Mars Mission Hazard Assessment Report

### Environmental Hazards Identified:
- **Crater terrain (N5)**: Unstable ground with high risk of collapse
- **Sandy terrain (N90)**: Loose soil causing radiation exposure and rover entrapment risks

### No-Go Zones:
- `N5` (Crater): High collapse risk
- `N90` (Sandy): Radiation exposure hazard

### Approved Targets for Operations:
- `N12`, `N45`, `N78` (Rocky terrain): Stable for subsurface sampling

### Action Sequence:
1. **Rover** at `N12` - Subsurface sampling
2. **Rover** at `N45` - Subsurface sampling
3. **Rover** at `N78` - Subsurface sampling

### Emergency Protocols:
- Radiation spikes in sandy terrain (`N90`): Retreat to rocky zones
- Crater instability (`N5`): Activate stabilization and abort operations
