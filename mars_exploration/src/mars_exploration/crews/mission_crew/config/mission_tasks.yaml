analyze_mission_report_task:
  description: >
    Read the report at {mission_report_path}.
    Extract the objectives (nodes and terrain), energy/time constraints,
    the priority hierarchy, and the hazards known.
  expected_output: >
    A structured summary with objectives, constraints, priorites, and intial hazards.
  agent: mission_planner

assess_hazards_task:
  description: >
    Use the terrain data from {terrain_data_path} and the report to identify hazardous nodes.
    Pay special attention to unstable, radiation and storms nodes.
    Determine which nodes are "No-Go" for the agents.
  expected_output: >
    List of hazard zones and restricted nodes.
  agent: hazard_assessment


optimize_resources_task:
  description: >
    Based on the constraints of the {mission_report_path}, define how to distribute time and energy
    to cover priority nodes.
  expected_output: >
    Dictionary of resource allocation and capacity warnings.
  agent: resource_optimization

prioritize_science_task:
  description: >
    Cross-reference the report objectives with the restricted zones identified by the Hazard Agent.
    If a high-priority node is hazardous, look for alternatives or re-prioritize.
  expected_output: >
    Final list of target nodes ordered by value and feasibility.
  agent: scientific_target_evaluator

synthesize_final_plan_task:
  description: >
    Combine scientific prioritization with resource and safety rules.
    Generate a clear action plan for Rover and Drone crews.
  expected_output: >
    Master plan with safe targets, resource rules, and emergency protocols.
